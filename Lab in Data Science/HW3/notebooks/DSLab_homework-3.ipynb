    "### Hashtags\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that when an event is happening and people are having a conversation about it on Twitter, a set of uniform hashtags that represent the event spontaneously evolves. Twitter users then use those hashtags to communicate with one another. Some hashtags, like `#RT` for \"retweet\" or just `#retweet` are used frequently and don't tell us much about what is going on. But a sudden appearance of a hashtag like `#oscars` probably indicates that the oscars are underway. For a particularly cool example of this type of analysis, check out [this blog post about earthquake detection using Twitter data](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/usgs-twitter-data-earthquake-detection.html) (although they search the text and not necessarily hashtags)."
